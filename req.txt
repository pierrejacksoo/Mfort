Generate in C a highly secured RHEL 10 modul named MFort that sécurise a PC add make a SELinux 2.0 version BUT not specialized on intern security and isolation of process but on hardware security so add detects new hardwares and type like USB or Charging Cable/other or Headphones or Headphones with mic or webcam or hotplug or networ cards or GPU etc. And add détection of use and reporting and asking if it's high severity to accept or decline the hardware add block HID attacks by detecting speed and more advanced technique (add 2) and add Crypto Mining (cryptojacking) and add bad USB or rubber ducky or bash bunny detection add more note I want that this code have only one file no headers and note I want sophisticated logics without simulations.
